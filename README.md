#xkcd-explainer

An exploration of AJAX and JSON APIs for the public good. 

Unfortunately, because the xkcd JSONP isn't served over HTTPS, this probably won't work in-browser. To try this out, you'll need to clone the repo and open index.htl. To try in your browser anyway, visit [this page](https://brahmcapoor.github.io/xkcd-explainer)
